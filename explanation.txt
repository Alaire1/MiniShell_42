main.c
- turing off displaying nin printable characters while using ctrl + C
- checks if we are not passing too many arguments
- initialization of env and export
    - first all the values from evn are copiedto the linked list (linked list is defined in the libft header file)
    - next we are allocating space for the both structs with appropriate struct type
    - env variabes are being split, so we can access name and value variabes
- inside whie loop
    - starting signals to work, we may go into details later on 
		signal(SIGQUIT, SIG_IGN) ignores the quit sygnal
    - getting input from readline
    - if input length is greater than zero we are adding it to the history
    - trimming input (function is in libft) just trimms the beggining and the end of the input
    -trimmed input is assigned to a new variabe and the od onr is bneing freed
    - checking validity of input
        - checking for uncosed quotes
        - checking for operators that cannot be used like (||, <>, <<<) while checking if they are or not inside quotes
          - after that we are checking if there are  no pipes that has nothing in between them or 
        - checking for invaid syntax
            -
        




EXECUTION
if there are pipes


if just one command (no pipes in the struct)
- add_whitespaces 
	-is adding white spaces before and after redirections if they are not inside quotes
-remove_redirs 
	-is counting how many whitespaces are in the current string
	-spliting the string by white spaces
	- if there are redirections 
	-assiging split arguments into a cmd_args array of strings
